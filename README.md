## Google Cloud Function Deployment Automation Script

This GitHub repository features a Python script designed to automate the deployment of a Google Cloud Function and its associated Cloud Storage bucket. The script provides a streamlined process for setting up and deploying a webhook function in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Script Functionality
1. **Check Google Cloud SDK Installation**: Verifies if the Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`) is installed on the system.
2. **Check Google Cloud Configuration**: Ensures that `gcloud` is configured with a cloud account.
3. **Create Cloud Storage Bucket**: Automates the creation of a new GCP Cloud Storage bucket.
4. **Create Cloud Function Files**: Generates necessary files (`index.js` and `package.json`) for the cloud function in a directory named `webhook-function`.
5. **Deploy Cloud Function**: Deploys the webhook function to Google Cloud Functions.
6. **Retrieve Cloud Function URL**: Obtains and displays the URL of the deployed cloud function.

### Key Features
- **Automated Setup and Deployment**: Simplifies the process of setting up and deploying Google Cloud Functions and storage resources.
- **Customizable Function Creation**: Dynamically creates function files based on user input, allowing for easy customization.
- **End-to-End Process**: Covers everything from initial checks to deployment and URL retrieval, making it user-friendly for both beginners and experienced users.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback on each step, ensuring any issues are quickly identified and addressed.

### Usage Scenario
This script is particularly valuable for developers and DevOps engineers who frequently work with Google Cloud Functions and need an efficient way to deploy webhook functions. It's also useful for educational purposes or automating repetitive deployment tasks in GCP.

### Prerequisites
- Google Cloud SDK installed and configured on the system.
- User permissions to create and deploy Google Cloud Functions and Cloud Storage buckets.

### Security and Best Practices
- Handle the generated service account keys and credentials securely.
- Follow best practices for managing and storing sensitive information, especially when automating deployment scripts.
